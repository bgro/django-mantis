QUICKSTART
===================================================================================

After installing mantis as described in the installation description,
have a try at the following:
 
 - Browse to::   
   
        127.0.0.1:8000/mantis

   and log in with user ``admin`` and password ``admin``

 - Use the menu bar at the top and select the first saved search
   that filters for STIX packages. This will show you all ``STIX_Package``
   objects that are in the system 

 - Click on one of the displayed packages and start exploring (have a look
    at the screenshots in the documentation for a quick guide through
    the application.)

 - You can also have a look at the Django admin interface at::

        127.0.0.1:8000/admin
